# GitHub Pages Deployment - Summary of Changes

## Changes Made

1. **Updated package.json**:
   - Added `"homepage": "https://xullac.github.io"` to specify the GitHub Pages URL
   - Added deployment scripts:
     ```json
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
     ```
   - Added gh-pages package to devDependencies:
     ```json
     "gh-pages": "^6.1.1"
     ```

2. **Added .nojekyll file**:
   - Created an empty .nojekyll file in the public folder to prevent GitHub Pages from using Jekyll processing

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install the gh-pages package that was added to your devDependencies.

2. **Deploy Your Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This will build your React application and deploy it to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository.

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Under "Branch", select "gh-pages" and "/(root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your site
   - Visit https://xullac.github.io to see your React application

## Detailed Instructions

For more detailed instructions, including troubleshooting tips, please refer to the `deployment_instructions.md` file.

## Why This Works

The issue was that GitHub Pages was displaying your README.md file instead of your React application because:

1. The repository wasn't properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment
2. The gh-pages package wasn't installed
3. The necessary deployment scripts weren't set up in package.json
4. The homepage URL wasn't specified in package.json

The changes we made address all these issues, allowing GitHub Pages to correctly serve your React application instead of the README.md file.
