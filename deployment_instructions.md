# Deploying Your React App to GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites
- Your React application is already connected to a GitHub repository
- You have made the necessary configuration changes to your package.json file
- You have installed the gh-pages package

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the gh-pages package that was added to your devDependencies.

### 2. Build and Deploy
Run the deploy script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
1. Run the predeploy script (npm run build) to create a production build of your app
2. Deploy the build folder to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository

### 3. Configure GitHub Pages Settings
After deploying, go to your GitHub repository:

1. Navigate to Settings > Pages
2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Under "Branch", select "gh-pages" and "/(root)" folder
4. Click "Save"

Your site should now be published at https://xullac.github.io

### 4. Verify Deployment
Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your site, then visit https://xullac.github.io to see your React application.

## Troubleshooting

### If your site is showing the README instead of your React app:
- Make sure the "homepage" field in package.json is set correctly to "https://xullac.github.io"
- Ensure you've run `npm run deploy` successfully
- Check that GitHub Pages is configured to use the gh-pages branch
- Verify that the .nojekyll file exists in your public folder

### If your site is showing a blank page:
- Check the browser console for errors
- Make sure all paths in your React app are relative, not absolute
- Verify that the build process completed successfully

### If you see 404 errors for resources:
- Make sure all resource paths in your code use relative paths or %PUBLIC_URL%
- Check that all assets are properly included in the build

## Future Deployments
Whenever you make changes to your application, simply run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build your app and deploy the updated version to GitHub Pages.
